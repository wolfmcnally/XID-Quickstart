## Introduction

This document provides practical examples of public participation profiles using XIDs, serving as a companion to the [Public Participation Profiles](public-participation-profiles.md) concept. These examples demonstrate how to balance the fundamental tension between privacy needs and contribution desires, enabling meaningful participation while protecting identity.

The examples are aligned with Amira's scenario throughout the tutorials, particularly her work on Ben's women's safety application. They show concrete implementations of the progressive trust approach described in [Progressive Trust Life Cycle](progressive-trust-lifecycle.md).

## Practical XID Implementation Examples

The following examples show how to implement participation profiles using XIDs and Gordian Envelopes, demonstrating patterns you can adapt for your own use cases.

### Example 1: BWHacker's Initial Profile

This minimal profile establishes Amira's initial presence as BWHacker:

```sh
# Create Amira's initial pseudonymous identity
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope xid new --name "BWHacker" "$PUBLIC_KEY")

# Add basic non-identifying information
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "domain" string "Distributed Systems & Security" "$AMIRA_XID")
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "purpose" string "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations" "$AMIRA_XID")
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "values" string "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use" "$AMIRA_XID")

# Technical skill declarations
SKILLS=$(envelope subject type string "TechnicalSkills")
SKILLS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "mobileDevelopment" string "Mobile application development with security focus" "$SKILLS")
SKILLS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "apiSecurity" string "Secure API implementation and authentication systems" "$SKILLS")
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "skills" envelope "$SKILLS" "$AMIRA_XID")

# Initial evidence commitment (without revealing the evidence)
EVIDENCE="Implemented secure authentication system with privacy-preserving features"
EVIDENCE_HASH=$(echo "$EVIDENCE" | envelope digest sha256)
AMIRA_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "evidenceCommitment" digest "$EVIDENCE_HASH" "$AMIRA_XID")
```

This example shows how Amira can create her initial BWHacker identity with:
- A stable identifier using her key pair
- General technical domain information
- Purpose and values statements aligned with Ben's women's safety app
- Technical skills relevant to the project
- An evidence commitment that can be selectively revealed later

At this initial stage, the profile contains minimal privacy risk while establishing basic credibility.

### Example 2: BWHacker's Women's Safety App Developer Profile

This expanded profile shows Amira's identity as it evolves for Ben's women's safety application:

```sh
# Start with the basic profile and expand it for the women's safety context
SAFETY_PROFILE=$(envelope subject type envelope "$AMIRA_XID")

# Add safety-specific technical skills
SAFETY_SKILLS=$(envelope subject type string "SafetyAppSkills")
SAFETY_SKILLS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "locationPrivacy" string "Privacy-preserving location sharing with minimal data exposure" "$SAFETY_SKILLS")
SAFETY_SKILLS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "emergencyFeatures" string "Reliable emergency alert mechanisms with offline capability" "$SAFETY_SKILLS")
SAFETY_SKILLS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "threatModeling" string "Threat modeling for safety applications protecting vulnerable users" "$SAFETY_SKILLS")
SAFETY_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "safetyAppSkills" envelope "$SAFETY_SKILLS" "$SAFETY_PROFILE")

# Add safety-focused principles
PRINCIPLES=$(envelope subject type string "SafetyPrinciples")
PRINCIPLES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "userControl" string "Users maintain full control of their information and sharing" "$PRINCIPLES")
PRINCIPLES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "minimumExposure" string "Minimize data collection and sharing while preserving essential functionality" "$PRINCIPLES")
PRINCIPLES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "resilience" string "System functions in adverse conditions like network unavailability" "$PRINCIPLES")
SAFETY_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "safetyPrinciples" envelope "$PRINCIPLES" "$SAFETY_PROFILE")

# Implementation examples (without identifying details)
IMPLEMENTATIONS=$(envelope subject type string "SafetyImplementations")
IMPLEMENTATIONS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "locationSystem" string "Location system that only shares data during emergency situations" "$IMPLEMENTATIONS")
IMPLEMENTATIONS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "offlineAlert" string "Emergency alert that works without internet connectivity" "$IMPLEMENTATIONS")
IMPLEMENTATIONS=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "secureStorage" string "Encrypted local storage with secure authentication" "$IMPLEMENTATIONS")
SAFETY_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "implementations" envelope "$IMPLEMENTATIONS" "$SAFETY_PROFILE")

# Add Charlene's endorsement
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope subject type string "PeerEndorsement")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorser" string "CharlieOne" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorsementDate" string "2023-06-15" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "skill" string "Mobile Security Architecture" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "observation" string "Demonstrated exceptional understanding of security for mobile applications" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "context" string "Collaborative work on privacy-focused features" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "basis" string "Direct collaboration on shared projects" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")

# Sign the endorsement with Charlene's key
SIGNED_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope sign -s "$CHARLENE_PRIVATE_KEY" "$CHARLENE_ENDORSEMENT")
SAFETY_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorsement" envelope "$SIGNED_ENDORSEMENT" "$SAFETY_PROFILE")
```

This example shows how Amira can develop a more specialized profile for the women's safety application context:
- Safety-specific technical skills relevant to Ben's project
- Security and privacy principles for safety applications
- Implementation examples focused on the women's safety context
- A peer endorsement from Charlene that validates her skills

This profile provides Ben with the specific trust signals needed for the safety application without compromising Amira's privacy.

### Example 3: Context-Specific Profile Views

This example shows how Amira can create different views of her profile for different contexts:

```sh
# Starting with the full safety app profile
FULL_PROFILE=$(envelope subject type envelope "$SAFETY_PROFILE")

# Create a public view for initial engagement
PUBLIC_VIEW=$(envelope subject type envelope "$FULL_PROFILE")
PUBLIC_VIEW=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "locationHistory" "$PUBLIC_VIEW" 1)
PUBLIC_VIEW=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "communicationPreferences" "$PUBLIC_VIEW" 1)
PUBLIC_VIEW=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "endorsement" "$PUBLIC_VIEW" 1)

# Create a project maintainer view for Ben
MAINTAINER_VIEW=$(envelope subject type envelope "$FULL_PROFILE")
MAINTAINER_VIEW=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "locationHistory" "$MAINTAINER_VIEW" 1)

# Create a security collaboration view for working on sensitive features
SECURITY_VIEW=$(envelope subject type envelope "$FULL_PROFILE")
SECURITY_VIEW=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "locationHistory" "$SECURITY_VIEW" 1)

# Sign different views with appropriate timestamps
SIGNED_PUBLIC_VIEW=$(envelope sign -s "$AMIRA_PRIVATE_KEY" "$PUBLIC_VIEW")
SIGNED_MAINTAINER_VIEW=$(envelope sign -s "$AMIRA_PRIVATE_KEY" "$MAINTAINER_VIEW")
SIGNED_SECURITY_VIEW=$(envelope sign -s "$AMIRA_PRIVATE_KEY" "$SECURITY_VIEW")
```

This example demonstrates how Amira can create tailored views of her profile:
- A public view for initial engagement with minimal information
- A project maintainer view with more detail for Ben as their trust develops
- A security collaboration view that includes sensitive skill information for working on critical features

Through selective disclosure using Gordian Envelope's elision capabilities, Amira maintains control over what information is revealed in each context while providing appropriate trust signals.

### Example 4: Progressive Trust Development

This example shows how Amira's profile evolves through different trust levels:

```sh
# Initial contact - minimal profile
INITIAL_PROFILE=$(envelope subject type string "BWHacker")
INITIAL_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "name" string "BWHacker" "$INITIAL_PROFILE")
INITIAL_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "domain" string "Mobile Security" "$INITIAL_PROFILE")
INITIAL_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "purpose" string "Contributing to privacy-focused applications" "$INITIAL_PROFILE")

# Regular contributor - expanded profile with evidence
REGULAR_PROFILE=$(envelope subject type envelope "$INITIAL_PROFILE")
REGULAR_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "experienceLevel" string "5+ years of development experience" "$REGULAR_PROFILE")
REGULAR_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "technicalSkills" string "Mobile security, privacy-preserving design, API security" "$REGULAR_PROFILE")

# Add implementation examples
EXAMPLES=$(envelope subject type string "ImplementationExamples")
EXAMPLES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "secureStorage" string "Encrypted local storage system with offline authentication" "$EXAMPLES")
EXAMPLES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "locationPrivacy" string "Privacy-preserving location sharing with minimal data collection" "$EXAMPLES")
REGULAR_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "examples" envelope "$EXAMPLES" "$REGULAR_PROFILE")

# Trusted contributor - with peer endorsements and deeper expertise
TRUSTED_PROFILE=$(envelope subject type envelope "$REGULAR_PROFILE")

# Add Carlos's endorsement (from Tutorial 4)
CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope subject type string "PeerEndorsement")
CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorser" string "Carlos_SecResearcher" "$CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT")
CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "projectName" string "Privacy-First Safety Alert System" "$CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT")
CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorsedSkill" string "Privacy-preserving location tracking" "$CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT")
CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "observation" string "Implemented privacy-preserving location tracking that minimizes data exposure risk" "$CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT")
SIGNED_CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope sign -s "$CARLOS_PRIVATE_KEY" "$CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT")

# Add Maya's code review endorsement (from Tutorial 4)
MAYA_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope subject type string "CodeReviewEndorsement")
MAYA_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorser" string "MayaCodeX" "$MAYA_ENDORSEMENT")
MAYA_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "repositoryURL" string "https://github.com/example/safety-location-privacy" "$MAYA_ENDORSEMENT")
MAYA_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "assessment" string "Excellent: Optimized location privacy algorithm with minimal battery impact" "$MAYA_ENDORSEMENT")
SIGNED_MAYA_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope sign -s "$MAYA_PRIVATE_KEY" "$MAYA_ENDORSEMENT")

# Add endorsements to trusted profile
TRUSTED_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorsement" envelope "$SIGNED_CARLOS_ENDORSEMENT" "$TRUSTED_PROFILE")
TRUSTED_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "endorsement" envelope "$SIGNED_MAYA_ENDORSEMENT" "$TRUSTED_PROFILE")

# Add specialized security expertise for women's safety applications
SECURITY_EXPERTISE=$(envelope subject type string "SafetySecurityExpertise")
SECURITY_EXPERTISE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "threatModeling" string "Comprehensive threat modeling for women's safety applications" "$SECURITY_EXPERTISE")
SECURITY_EXPERTISE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "adversarialTesting" string "Testing features against realistic adversarial scenarios" "$SECURITY_EXPERTISE")
TRUSTED_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "securityExpertise" envelope "$SECURITY_EXPERTISE" "$TRUSTED_PROFILE")
```

This example demonstrates how Amira's profile evolves through the progressive trust life cycle:
- Initial contact stage with minimal information
- Regular contributor stage with more skills and examples
- Trusted contributor stage with peer endorsements and deeper expertise

The profile builds trust gradually while maintaining privacy protection throughout, showing how Amira can engage more deeply with Ben's project as trust develops.

## Connection to Tutorials

These examples directly connect to the implementations in the tutorials:

### Connection to Tutorial 1: Your First XID

In [Tutorial 1](../tutorials/01-your-first-xid/tutorial-01.md), Amira creates her first XID as BWHacker, establishing her pseudonymous identity. The implementation follows a similar pattern to the initial profile example:

```sh
# In Tutorial 1, Amira creates her initial XID
envelope xid new --name "BWHacker" "$AMIRA_PUBLIC" > amira-xid.envelope
```

The BWHacker profile created in Tutorial 1 serves as the foundation for Amira's pseudonymous participation with Ben's project.

### Connection to Tutorial 3: Self-Attestation with XIDs

In [Tutorial 3](../tutorials/03-self-attestation-with-xids.md), Amira expands her profile with self-attestations about her skills and experience, similar to the "Regular Contributor" example:

```sh
# In Tutorial 3, Amira adds skills and project experience
PROJECT=$(envelope subject type string "Privacy-Focused Safety App")
PROJECT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "role" string "Security & Privacy Engineer" "$PROJECT")
PROJECT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "timeframe" string "2022-01 through 2022-06" "$PROJECT")
PROJECT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "client" string "Nonprofit organization (details available after NDA)" "$PROJECT")
```

The self-attestations in Tutorial 3 follow the patterns shown in the Technical Competence and Public Interest sections of the taxonomy, focusing on skills relevant to the women's safety application.

### Connection to Tutorial 4: Peer Endorsement with XIDs

In [Tutorial 4](../tutorials/04-peer-endorsement-with-xids.md), Amira's profile evolves to include peer endorsements, just as shown in the "Trusted Contributor" example:

```sh
# In Tutorial 4, peers endorse Amira's skills
COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "projectName" string "Privacy-First Safety Alert System" "$COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT")
COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "repositoryURL" string "https://github.com/example/privacy-alert-system" "$COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT")
COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "collaborationContext" string "Joint development of privacy-preserving location features for a women's safety app" "$COLLABORATION_ENDORSEMENT")
```

The peer endorsement model in Tutorial 4 implements the Peer-Endorsed Skills section of the taxonomy, showing how third-party attestations strengthen BWHacker's credibility for Ben's project.
