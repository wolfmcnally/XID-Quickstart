## Introduction to Public Participation Profiles

Public participation profiles enable contributors to engage in
projects aligned with their values while maintaining control over
their personal information. These profiles are essential for
individuals who need to balance meaningful contribution with privacy
protection.

For many individuals like Amira, participating in projects creates a
fundamental tension:

- **Contribution Desires**: Meaningful participation in projects
    aligned with their values and skills
- **Privacy Needs**: Protection from surveillance, discrimination,
    retaliation, or unwanted exposure

Public participation profiles resolve this tension by creating
structured, verifiable, [pseudonymous](pseudonymous-trust-building.md)
digital representations that allow contributors to share what's
necessary for trust while protecting what needs to remain private.

This document is a capstone, merging many of the past lessons into a
coherent whole.

## The Risk-Reward Calculus of Participation

Pseudonymous contributors must carefully weigh the risks and rewards
of participation:

### Risk Assessment Factors

1. **Community Quality**: Will the community respect privacy boundaries?
2. **Association Risk**: Could this information link to legal identity?
3. **Uniqueness Risk**: How distinctive is this skill or experience?
4. **Correlation Risk**: Could multiple disclosures be combined to identify me?
5. **Temporal Risk**: Does this reveal a timeline that could be connected to me?
6. **Network Risk**: Does this expose connections to known associates?

### Benefit Assessment Factors

1. **Value Alignment**: How important is this project to personal values?
2. **Trust Transferability**: Can trust built here transfer to other contexts?

### Impact vs Disclosure

A risk-reward calculus can now combine benefits into an impact
potential and use that to assess what information to include in a public
participation profile, following the principle of **proportional
disclosure**: higher-value projects justify higher (but still minimal)
disclosure.

1. **Impact Potential**: How significant is the potential contribution?
2. **Trust Threshold**: What's the minimum disclosure needed for the desired role?

### Balancing Disclosure Across Project Types


**Documentation Projects:**

- **Minimal disclosure needed**: Basic pseudonymous identity and writing skills
- **Focus on**: Quality of writing and accuracy of content
- **Trust signals**: Clarity, completeness, and accuracy of contributions

**Application Development:**

- **Moderate disclosure needed**: Technical skills and collaboration abilities
- **Focus on**: Code quality, testing practices, design approach
- **Trust signals**: Pull request quality, test coverage, code reviews

**Security-Critical Projects:**

- **Significant trust required**: Security expertise and ethical commitment
- **Focus on**: Security knowledge, threat modeling ability, ethics
- **Trust signals**: Security-focused contributions, vulnerability handling

**Governance Participation:**

- **Highest trust requirements**: Long-term commitment and values alignment
- **Focus on**: Project values, decision-making approach, conflict resolution
- **Trust signals**: Consistent demonstration of project values, contribution history


## Core Components of Participation Profiles

XIDs provide an ideal foundation for building participation profiles
that balance privacy and trust:

### 1. Stable Pseudonymous Identifier

The foundation of a participation profile is a stable,
cryptographically-verifiable identifier, such as a XID, that doesn't
reveal real-world identity.

The XID provides:
- Consistent identity across interactions
- No inherent connection to real-world identity
- Cryptographic verification of control of identity (via private key)

_For more, see [XID Fundamentals](xid.md)._

### 2. Value and Purpose Statements

Value statements establish alignment without revealing personal
background.

Effective privacy-respecting value statements:
- Focus on universal principles rather than specific circumstances
- Connect to project goals rather than personal background
- Demonstrate alignment without revealing motivations
- Show commitment to ethical practices

### 3. Self-Attestations of Technical Capability

Self-attestations establish baseline skills and experience, again
without specific identity disclosure.

Effective privacy-respecting self-attestations:
- Focus on relevant skills, not chronological history
- Provide specific technical domains rather than job titles
- Express experience in years rather than dates
- Highlight distinctive capabilities without uniquely identifying details

_For more, see [Attestation & Endorsement
Model](attestation-endorsement-model.md)._

### 4. Verifiable Evidence Commitments

Some values or self-attestations might need to be hidden from the
general public, while the identity still commits to them. This can be
done with evidence commitments, which allow contributors to prove
capabilities without revealing sensitive information.

Evidence commitments enable:
- Cryptographic verification that evidence existed at a certain time
- Selective disclosure to specific parties
- Verification without public exposure
- Progressive trust development

_For more, see [Pseudonymous Trust
Building](pseudonymous-trust-building.md).__

### 5. Peer Attestations and Endorsements

Peer attestations provide independent verification while preserving
pseudonymity.

There is less concern about peer endorsements being specifically
privacy-preserving, because they likely came from peers who have only
interacted with the pseudonymous identity.

Effective peer attestations:

- Come from other trusted community members
- Verify specific skills or contributions
- Provide context about collaborative relationship
- Include cryptographic signatures for verification

_For more, see [Attestation & Endorsement
Model](attestation-endorsement-model.md)._

But of course there's the opportunity for more expansion in the
future, as part of a participation profile lifecycle.

## Best Practices for Participation Profiles

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with the least amount of disclosure needed for initial contribution.
2. **Focus on Evidence**: Emphasize verifiable work rather than credentials or background.
3. **Collect Targeted Endorsements**: Gather attestations specific to relevant skills and contexts.
4. **Use Elision Strategically**: Create context-appropriate views for different interactions.
5. **Update Progressively**: Add information gradually as trust develops.
6. **Maintain Context Separation**: Use different profiles for different domains if necessary.
7. **Document Boundaries**: Clearly communicate what information you will and won't share.
8. **Establish Verification Methods**: Define how others can verify your contributions
9. **Build Consistent Patterns**: Establish recognizable work patterns without revealing identity
10. **Consider Recovery Options**: Plan for key management and profile recovery


## The Participation Profile Lifecycle

Public participation profiles evolve over time through a structured
lifecycle.

### Phase 1: Initial Participation

Start with minimal disclosure:

- Create basic pseudonymous identifier.
- Commit to project values.
- Define general skill areas.
- Elide information that is too private; and/or
   - Create evidence commitments for future usage.
- Offer small initial contributions.

This phase establishes basic presence with minimal privacy risk.

### Phase 2: Contribution Validation

Build trust through validated contributions:

- Contribute solutions relevant to the project.
- Test implementations of project features.
- Offer specific technical skills with evidence.
- Provide work samples that can be evaluated on merit.

This phase demonstrates capabilities without revealing background.

### Phase 3: Reputation Development

Strengthen trust through peer relationships:

- Consistently contribute to project.
- Deepen engagement within safe boundaries.
- Reveal commitments to specific individual as trust progresses; and/or
   - Remove elisions.
- Target endorsements from community members.
- Request collaboration attestations showing teamwork.
- Incorporate endorsements and attestations into profile.
- Create trust networks among peers.

This phase establishes community trust while maintaining privacy.

### Phase 4: Role Expansion

Take on greater responsibility based on earned trust:

- Offer leadership in specific domain areas.
- Expand decision-making authority.
- Provide mentorship to newer contributors.
- Take on component ownership or maintenance.

This phase leverages established trust for greater impact.

### Phase 5: Profile Updates

Engage in logistical updates of profiles as necessary.

- Change goals or values.
- Add self-attestations for experience.
- Remove or rotate keys.
- Revoke profile.

## Verifying Public Contributions

A XID's public key can be used to verify contributions without
revealing identity.

```sh
# Verify contribution signature
envelope verify -v "$PUBLIC_KEY" "$SIGNED_CONTRIBUTION"
```


## Practical Implementation: Public Participation Profiles

### 1. Stable Pseudonymous Identifier

```sh
# Create a stable pseudonymous identifier
SEED=$(envelope generate seed)
ur:seed/oyadgdonrysoladirysspriofnbtlgcegoykpraabelfsp
PRIVATE_KEY=$(envelope generate prvkeys --seed $SEED)
PUBLIC_KEY=$(envelope generate pubkeys $PRIVATE_KEY)
PROFILE_XID=$(envelope xid new --nickname "BRadvoc8" "$PUBLIC_KEY")
XID=$(envelope xid id "$PROFILE_XID")
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

### 2. Value and Purpose Statements

```sh
# Add value and purpose assertions
PROFILE_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "purpose" string "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations" "$PROFILE_XID")
PROFILE_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "values" string "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use" "$PROFILE_XID")
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

### 3. Self-Attestations of Technical Capability

```sh

PROFILE_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "coreSkills" string "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security" "$PROFILE_XID")
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
    "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
    "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
    "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

### 4. Verifiable Evidence Commitments

```sh
# Create evidence commitment
PROJECT_SUMMARY="Designed privacy-preserving location system for safety applications"
SUMMARY_HASH=$(echo "$PROJECT_SUMMARY" | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}')
SUMMARY_HASH_BW=$(bytewords -i hex "5820"$SUMMARY_HASH -o minimal)
SUMMARY_HASH_UR="ur:digest/"$SUMMARY_HASH_BW
PROFILE_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "evidenceCommitment" digest "$SUMMARY_HASH_UR" "$PROFILE_XID")
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
    "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
    "evidenceCommitment": Digest(c0d10cdd)
    "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
    "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [

        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

### 5. Peer Attestations and Endorsements

```sh
# Add peer attestation from another pseudonymous contributor
PROFILE_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string peerEndorsements envelope $SIGNED_ENDORSEMENT $PROFILE_XID)
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
    "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
    "evidenceCommitment": Digest(c0d10cdd)
    "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
    "peerEndorsements": {
        "Endorsement: Financial API Project" [
            "basis": "Direct observation throughout the project plus review of metrics"
            "endorsementTarget": XID(e94de728)
            "endorser": "TechPM - Project Manager with 12 years experience"
            "endorserLimitation": "Limited technical background in cryptography"
            "observation": "BRadvoc8 designed innovative authentication system that exceeded security requirements"
            "potentialBias": "Had management responsibility for project success"
            "relationship": "Direct project oversight as Project Manager"
        ]
    } [
        'signed': Signature
    ]
    "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

## Practical Implementation: The Participation Profile Lifecycle

A public participation profile can continue to change over
time. Following are examples of some of the changes that might occur
as part of a participation profile lifecycle.

### 1. Selective Disclosure

Gordian Envelopes enable context-specific views of the same
profile. This may be used early in a participation profile lifecycle
to limit disclosure.

```sh
# Create context-specific view for a technical collaboration
PROFILE_PURPOSE=$(envelope assertion find predicate string "purpose" $PROFILE_XID)
TECHNICAL_VIEW=$(envelope elide removing $PROFILE_PURPOSE $PROFILE_XID)
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
    "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
    "evidenceCommitment": Digest(c0d10cdd)
    "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
    "peerEndorsements": {
        "Endorsement: Financial API Project" [
            "basis": "Direct observation throughout the project plus review of metrics"
            "endorsementTarget": XID(e94de728)
            "endorser": "TechPM - Project Manager with 12 years experience"
            "endorserLimitation": "Limited technical background in cryptography"
            "observation": "BRadvoc8 designed innovative authentication system that exceeded security requirements"
            "potentialBias": "Had management responsibility for project success"
            "relationship": "Direct project oversight as Project Manager"
        ]
    } [
        'signed': Signature
    ]
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
    ELIDED
]
```

### 2. Progressive Trust Building

XIDs support the gradual addition of attestations and
endorsements. This "Reputation Development" occurs after early rounds
of the Participation Profile Liifecycle and allows for the addition of
more endorsements over time.

```sh
# Add new peer attestation after successful collaboration
UPDATED_PROFILE=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "peerEndorsements" envelope "$SIGNED_NEW_ENDORSEMENT" "$PROFILE_XID")
```

```
XID(e94de728) [
    "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
    "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
    "evidenceCommitment": Digest(c0d10cdd)
    "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
    "peerEndorsements": {
        "Endorsement: Financial API Project" [
            "basis": "Direct observation throughout the project plus review of metrics"
            "endorsementTarget": XID(e94de728)
            "endorser": "TechPM - Project Manager with 12 years experience"
            "endorserLimitation": "Limited technical background in cryptography"
            "observation": "BRadvoc8 designed innovative authentication system that exceeded security requirements"
            "potentialBias": "Had management responsibility for project success"
            "relationship": "Direct project oversight as Project Manager"
        ]
    } [
        'signed': Signature
    ]
    "peerEndorsements": {
        "Endorsement: Financial Privacy Project" [
            "endorsementTarget": XID(e94de728)
            "endorser": "architect of nuPri privacy format"
            "observation": "BRadvoc8 implemented my architecture quickly and accurately, but also offered refinements which improvements! A++++"
        ]
    } [
        'signed': Signature
    ]
    "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
    "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
    'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
        'allow': 'All'
        'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
    ]
]
```

### 3. Revocable Credentials

XIDs support revocation of a profile if circumstances change:

```sh
# Update status of a credential
WRAPPED_XID=$(envelope subject type wrapped $PROFILE_XID)
WRAPPED_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "credentialStatus" string "revoked" "$WRAPPED_XID")
WRAPPED_XID=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "revocationDate" string "2023-11-30" $WRAPPED_XID)
WRAPPED_REVOCATION=$(envelope subject type wrapped $WRAPPED_XID)
SIGNED_REVOCATION=$(envelope sign -s $PRIVATE_KEY $WRAPPED_REVOCATION)
```

```
{
    {
        XID(e94de728) [
            "coreSkills": "Cryptographic protocols, distributed consensus, mobile security"
            "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
            "evidenceCommitment": Digest(c0d10cdd)
            "experienceLevel": "8 years professional development"
            "peerEndorsements": {
                "Endorsement: Financial API Project" [
                    "basis": "Direct observation throughout the project plus review of metrics"
                    "endorsementTarget": XID(e94de728)
                    "endorser": "TechPM - Project Manager with 12 years experience"
                    "endorserLimitation": "Limited technical background in cryptography"
                    "observation": "BRadvoc8 designed innovative authentication system that exceeded security requirements"
                    "potentialBias": "Had management responsibility for project success"
                    "relationship": "Direct project oversight as Project Manager"
                ]
            } [
                'signed': Signature
            ]
            "purpose": "Contributing to privacy-preserving systems that protect vulnerable populations"
            "values": "Privacy as a human right, user agency, ethical data use"
            'key': PublicKeys(71e87c7e) [
                'allow': 'All'
                'nickname': "BRadvoc8"
            ]
        ]
    } [
        "credentialStatus": "revoked"
        "revocationDate": "2023-11-30"
    ]
} [
    'signed': Signature
]
```

### 4. Trust Networks

XIDs enable networks of verified relationships between pseudonymous identities:

```sh
# Establish trust relationship between pseudonyms
XID_TRUST=$XID
XID_TRUST=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "trusts" string "$TARGET_XID" "$XID_TRUST")
XID_TRUST=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "context" string "Code Review" "$XID_TRUST")
XID_TRUST=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "trustLevel" string "0.8" "$XID_TRUST")
XID_TRUST_WRAPPED=$(envelope subject type wrapped $XID_TRUST)
XID_TRUST_SIGNED=$(envelope sign -s $PRIVATE_KEY $XID_TRUST_WRAPPED)
```

```
{
    XID(e94de728) [
        "context": "Code Review"
        "trustLevel": "0.8"
        "trusts": "ur:xid/hdcximlecmgugsgdeymkhdoxcyjswyonnebyaykepsjtjktkvwpywktolpkotsbspdoldeecwsfh"
    ]
} [
    'signed': Signature
]
```
