# XID Concepts: Understanding the Foundation

## What This Is & Why To Read It

This guide documents the conceptual foundation of eXtensible IDentifiers (XIDs) and the Gordian architecture. These concepts explain how XIDs work, why specific design choices were made, and how the components interact to create a privacy-preserving identity system.

### First Time Here?

XIDs (eXtensible IDentifiers) are 32-byte cryptographic identifiers derived from public keys. They provide:
- Stable identifiers that persist through key rotation and device changes
- Selective disclosure through cryptographic elision (removal of data while maintaining verifiability)
- Gradual trust building without requiring legal identity disclosure
- User control over identity data and disclosure decisions

This is experimental technology. The implementations continue to evolve as we explore the implications of elision-first design and progressive trust models.

Reading these concepts helps you:
- Understand the cryptographic and architectural principles before implementation
- Learn the privacy and security trade-offs in identity system design
- Contribute to the development of self-sovereign identity

Key topics covered:
- How XIDs maintain stable identifiers through key changes
- Cryptographic techniques for selective disclosure
- Trust building without identity revelation
- Practical identity management frameworks

## Introduction to XIDs and Gordian Architecture

The XID-Quickstart tutorial introduces the Gordian architecture—a technology stack developed by Blockchain Commons that implements self-sovereign identity, data minimization, and progressive trust building.

The Gordian architecture includes:
- **XIDs** (eXtensible IDentifiers): Privacy-preserving digital identifiers
- **Gordian Envelopes**: Document format for selective disclosure
- **Cryptographic libraries**: Tools for security and verification

XIDs demonstrate how the Gordian architecture provides:
- **Self-sovereign identity**: User control over digital identity
- **Data minimization**: Sharing only necessary information
- **Progressive trust**: Building verifiable reputation over time
- **Key resilience**: Identity stability through key changes

These concepts explain how users control their digital identities while building verifiable reputation.

## Core Concepts

If you're new to XIDs and Gordian Envelopes, start with these fundamental concepts:

1. [XID](xid.md) - Understanding eXtensible IDentifiers
   - 32-byte cryptographic identifiers derived from public key hashes
   - Remain stable through key rotation, device changes, and recovery procedures
   - Enable consistent pseudonymous identity across time and contexts

2. [Gordian Envelope](gordian-envelope.md) - The data structure that powers XIDs
   - Structured data format using subject-predicate-object triples
   - Supports cryptographic signing, encryption, and selective disclosure
   - Maintains document verifiability after data removal

3. [Data Minimization](data-minimization.md) - Controlling information disclosure
   - Principle of sharing only necessary information for each interaction

   - Mathematical foundations for removing data while preserving integrity
   - Merkle trees and salted hashes prevent correlation of elided data
   - Enables partial document disclosure with cryptographic proof

## Trust Model Concepts

These concepts cover how trust is built, verified, and managed in a privacy-preserving environment:

1. [Fair Witness](fair-witness.md) - Making trustworthy assertions
   - Framework requiring transparency about context, methodology, and limitations
   - Explicit disclosure of potential biases and observational constraints
   - Applies to both self-attestations and peer endorsements

2. [Attestation & Endorsement Model](attestation-endorsement-model.md) - Framework for claims and verification
   - Self-attestations: structured claims about personal capabilities
   - Verifiable self-attestations: claims with independently checkable evidence
   - Peer endorsements: third-party verification requiring recipient acceptance

3. [Progressive Trust](progressive-trust.md) - Building trust incrementally over time
   - Ten-phase lifecycle from initial contact to sustained collaboration
   - Context-specific trust evaluations based on risk assessment
   - Restores human agency in trust decisions

4. [Pseudonymous Trust Building](pseudonymous-trust-building.md) - Building trust without revealing identity
   - Reputation building through cryptographic evidence commitments
   - Iterative trust lifecycles that expand based on demonstrated reliability
   - Peer endorsements that establish credibility without legal identity

## Privacy & Identity Concepts

These concepts explore additional aspects of privacy, identity, and key management:

1. [Public Participation Profiles](public-participation-profiles.md) - Managing public identity and reputation
   - Framework combining XIDs, attestations, and progressive trust concepts
   - Structured lifecycle for project participation with privacy preservation
   - Risk-based disclosure strategies for different contribution contexts

2. [Public Participation Profile Examples](public-participation-profile-examples.md) - Assertion taxonomy for trust levels
   - Preliminary taxonomy of assertions for participation contexts
   - Progressive disclosure patterns from anonymous to identified participation
   - Note: Contains draft material requiring domain expert review

3. [Key Management Essentials](key-management.md) - Securing and managing cryptographic keys
   - Trust-based key hierarchies with progressive permission models
   - Key rotation strategies that maintain XID stability
   - Recovery procedures that preserve identity continuity
