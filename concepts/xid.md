# XID Fundamentals

## Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end of this document, you will:

- Understand what XIDs and XID Documents (XIDDocs) are and why they're valuable
- Know how XIDs are derived from cryptographic keys
- Be familiar with basic XID document structure
- Know when to use XIDs for pseudonymous identity

## What Are XIDs?

An XID (eXtensible IDentifier, pronounced "zid") is a unique 32-byte identifier derived from a cryptographic key. It provides a stable digital identity that remains consistent even as the keys associated with it evolve over time.

For example, an XID might look like this:
```
7e1e25d7c4b9e4c92753f4476158e972be2fbbd9dffdd13b0561b5f1177826d3
```

For convenience, XIDs are often shown in shortened form using just the first few bytes:

```
🅧 7e1e25d7
```

### Stability Through Change

One of the most powerful aspects of XIDs is that they maintain a stable identifier even as associated keys change:

1. The XID is derived from the initial "inception" key
2. Additional keys can be added or removed without affecting the XID
3. The original key can eventually be rotated out entirely
4. The identifier remains consistent throughout these changes

This stability allows for:

- Secure key rotation without disrupting existing relationships
- Addition of device-specific keys while maintaining the same identity
- Recovery from key loss without losing your established identity
- Progressive trust building over time with a consistent identifier


## How XIDs Are Created

An XID is created as follows:

1. Generate a cryptographic key pair (public and private keys)
2. Take the SHA-256 hash of the public key material
3. This hash becomes the stable identifier (the XID)

In the [envelope-cli
tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust), the
process looks like this:

```
PRIVATE_KEYS=$(envelope generate prvkeys)
PUBLIC_KEYS=$(envelope generate pubkeys "$PRIVATE_KEYS")
XID_DOC=$(envelope xid new --nickname "MyIdentifier" "$PUBLIC_KEYS")
XID=$(envelope xid id "$XID_DOC")
```

Note that `$XID_DOC` will contain the full document, while `$XID` will only contain the XID, each in `ur:xid` form.

## XID Document Structure

An XID alone is just an identifier. The real power comes from the XID document ("XIDDoc"), a [Gordian Envelope](gordian-envelope-basics.md) containing structured data about the XID:

```
envelope format $XID_DOC

│ XID(d4563b8a) [
│     'key': PublicKeys(c014ce8e, SigningPublicKey(d4563b8a, SchnorrPublicKey(9092a60b)), EncapsulationPublicKey(5f8ecda4, X25519PublicKey(5f8ecda4))) [
│         'allow': 'All'
│         'nickname': "MyIdentifier"
│     ]
│ ]
```

The XIDDoc contains:

- The name of the identity
- Public key material
- Additional assertions about the identity
- Additional keys with specific permissions
- Other relevant information for verification

## When to Use XIDs for Pseudonymous Identity

XIDs are important for situations where pseudonymity is required. This includes the following use cases:

1. **Privacy is required**: You need to participate without revealing
your real identity.
2. **Identity persistence matters**: You need a stable identifier even
as your keys or devices change.
3. **Trust must be verifiable**: Others need to verify that your
contributions come from the same identity.
4. **Cryptographic verification is important**: You need to prove
control without revealing identity.

In addition, XIDs can support [progressive trust](progressive-trust-lifecycle.md):

5. **Progressive disclosure is needed**: You want to reveal information gradually as trust develops.

Opens source software development offers another convincing use case, as developers might wish to maintain their privacy, but users will need to trust the continuity of the software design. The [tutorials](../tutorials/) explore this use case through the story of Amira.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

XIDs work together with:

- [**Gordian Envelopes**](gordian-envelope-basics.md): The data structure that enables XID documents
- [**Fair Witness assertions**](fair-witness-approach.md): A framework for making verifiable claims with an XID
- [**Data minimization**](data-minimization-principles.md): Techniques to control what information is revealed
- [**Progressive trust**](progressive-trust-lifecycle.md): A model for building trust relationships over time

## Check Your Understanding

1. How is an XID derived from a cryptographic key?
2. What is the difference between a XID and a XID document?
3. What types of information can be included in a XID document?
4. When would you want to use a pseudonymous XID rather than your real identity?

## Next Steps
